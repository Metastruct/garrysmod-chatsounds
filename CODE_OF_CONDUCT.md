All of the current developers at the time when this document was composed, have pledged to govern their interactions with each other, and with the larger Meta Construct user community in accordance with the "instruments of good works" from chapter 4 of The Rule of St. Benedict (hereafter: "The Rule"). 

This code of ethics has proven its mettle in thousands of diverse communities for over 1,500 years, and has served as a baseline 
for many civil law codes since the time of Charlemagne.

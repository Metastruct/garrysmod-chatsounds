1.	Fork the repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

=== using GitHub for Windows: https://windows.github.com/ ===
2.	Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds
		( or if you forked: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/garrysmod-chatsounds )

=== using TortoiseSVN: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html ===
2.	Right click in your addons folder and "SVN Checkout..." the url: https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/trunk
		( or if you forked: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/garrysmod-chatsounds/trunk )

3.	Add the sounds using the preferred format.
	
	=============================================
	format      : ogg
	ogg quality : ~30% / ~3
	sample rate : 44.1 kHz
	channels    : mono (if it's music use stereo)
	bit depth   : 16 bit
	=============================================
	
	Name your folders properly
	Ensure that you can spell

4.	Make sure you remove left over files that aren't ogg files
5.	If necessary, you can add a "map.txt" into the folder that contains lines formatted like this:
		[source] ; [dest]
	or like this
		[source] ; [dest]; replace
	[source] is the sound name that you want to copy or move
	[dest] is the sound name that you want to copy or move to
	'replace' is a keyword that you can add to move instead of copy
	The file is executed from top to bottom.
	"sound name" can refer to either single sounds or entire sound groups.
	If [dest] exists already, [source] will be added/merged (see the example below).

	If you have a sound named "single" and a sound group "multi", you could, for example, create such a map:
		single; single2
		single ;single3
		single2;single4
		single; single1; replace
		multi; multiple; replace
		single1; multiple

	This would change the generated list from the default:
		single = single.ogg; multi = {multi/1.ogg, multi/2.ogg}
	to something like this:
		single1 = single.ogg
		single2 = single.ogg
		single3 = single.ogg
		single4 = single.ogg
		multiple = {multi/1.ogg, multi/2.ogg, single.ogg}

	Note, you can't add a line like "single; singleX" to the bottom of this example file because at that point "single"
	doesn't exist anymore (it has been moved in line 4 ("single; single1; replace" <- note the "replace" keyword))

6.	Run "chatsounds-preprocessor.exe" in the root of the repo ( optional, will be generated by a CI script
		and committed as a separate commit in case you don't run it )
7.	Commit!! ( and Sync if using GitHub for Windows )

8.	If you forked you will need to create a "Pull Request": https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/
		( if using GitHub for Windows you can click the button to the left of "Sync" to do a pull request
		but be sure to select "Metastruct/master" as the destination branch )


You can use Audacity, foobar2000 or Adobe Audition to convert to ogg.

2.	Select "Ogg Vorbis", then press Edit and set Quality to q3.0
3.	Press OK, then Convert
4.	At this step you will be required to specify path to oggenc2, if you haven't done it already.
	Download it from here: http://www.rarewares.org/files/ogg/oggenc2.87-1.3.3-generic.zip
	Put it in some folder and specify path to it when foobar2000 prompts for it.


In Adobe Audition it helps to make markers and name markers that you can export all at once in the end.
In Audacity you can attach marker to current selection by pressing Ctrl-B.
